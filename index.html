       <p>North Carolina is better known as the Tar-Heel State for its history of producing Tar. During the American Civil War the Yankees found the soldiers in North Carolina stuck to their guns like tar sticks to heels. While historically it was a pro slave state and was part of the confederacy, modern day North Carolina is known as a swing state but headed towards being only a Democrat or Blue State</p>
